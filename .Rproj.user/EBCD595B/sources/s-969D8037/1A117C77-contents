#This is a R script for managing data from PAM curves
##First we need to read the .csv file and create as many data frames as measurements we have in our raw file
#Check the files in our WD
list.files()
#Change the name of the file if needed
file.rename("PAM.CSV","PAMDATA.CSV")
#Now let's read the csv and create a data frame from it in a new variable
data <- read.csv("PAMDATA.CSV",header = TRUE, sep = ",", dec = ".")
#Now we have a data frame to manage our data
